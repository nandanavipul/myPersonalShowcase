                <h2>About Me!</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello viewers! This is me, Nandana Vipul. 
                    I might consider myself boring, but people around me say I got a lot of energy for an introvert, maybe I guess?.
                    When you're with the right people, spending energy isn't so bad.
                    I am curious when the topic is bound to be a sector of curiousity.
                    Totally my very first steps of coding so bear with me as I pave the way here!

                </p>
                <p>
                   I learnt Artificial Intelligence back at my school and I didn't learn a hint of code (I don't know the reason),
                   so learning Python during the vacation was in my to-do lists, albeit I wasn't that serious about it.
                   Then C enters the chat with all the crazy syntaxes which blowed up my mind, still living tho.
                   Now I'm here learning bit of html and css all for the Winter Arc, Huzzah!

                <p>
                    I love knowing the fashion trends but I am more inclined to the older, and timeless trends which I believe are classic and never go out of style!
                    Experimenting with makeup is another way of self-expression.
